# pi_flexform Update

## Updates data in pi_flexform

This extension is a collection of special purpose upgrade wizards. 
If you want to replace values in the pi_flexform field, you have to write your own code. 
The existing scripts only serve as a template. So this extension is for developers only.  

The extension can do this for you:

* Upgrade wizard PiflexformupdateXblogGrid: Updates the grid of xBlog plugin main 
  from 8|4 to 9|3 and 4|8 to 3|9, if image height is 165 pixel and width is 220 pixel.
